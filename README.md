## Kerckhoffs's principle
Kerckhoffs's principle is one of the basic principles of modern cryptography. It was formulated in the end of the nineteenth century by Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs. The principle goes as follows: A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. Kerckhoffs's principle is applied in virtually all contemporary encryption algorithms (DES, AES, etc.). These algorithms are considered to be secure and thoroughly investigated. The security of the encrypted message depends solely on the security of the secret encryption key (its quality).

Keeping algorithms secret may act as a significant barrier to cryptanalysis, but only if such algorithms are used in a strictly limited circle, which protects the algorithm from being revealed. Most government ciphers are kept secret. Commercial encryption algorithms, released to the market, have mostly been broken quite swiftly.

Kerckhoffs's principle was reformulated (perhaps independently) by Claude Shannon as "The enemy knows the system". In that form it is called Shannon's maxim.

## Shannon's maxim
 One ought to design systems under the assumption that the enemy will immediately gain full familiarity with them.
